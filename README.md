 # Summary

<p>
In this project the Bash Kernel of Jupyter is used as training ground for Bash.<br>
The challenge is less the Bash programming language than setting up the environment in Jupyter.<br>
Several problems with regard to this are discussed below and solutions provided<br>
</p>

<p>
The set up required the Bash Kernel, connecting Anaconda to Bash, and starting Bash from Gitbash.
This made the %% Bash cell magic work here.
<p>

<p>
"Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.<br>

<p>

<p>
A lot of Bash functionality is explored here, for example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bash basics like changing and making directories.</li>
  <li>Concatenating</li>
  <li>Selecting variables and text with grep and egrep</li>
  <li>Creating bash and txt files.</li>
  <li>For Loops</li>
  <li>While Loops</li>
  <li>Shell variables</li>
  <li>If-Else statements</li>
  <li>Bash functions</li>
  <li>Doing calculations with bc</li>
  <li>Using String arrays.</li>
</ul> 

<p>
This is an ongoing project and is going to be extended in the future.
